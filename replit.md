### Production
- **Build Process**: 
  - Frontend built with Vite to `dist/public`
  - Backend bundled with esbuild to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment Target**: Replit Autoscale
- **Port Configuration**: Express serves on port 5000, mapped to external port 80
- **Static Files**: Express serves built frontend from `dist/public`

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for AI features (optional)
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment indicator (development/production)

## UI/UX Improvements (June 18, 2025)

**User Feedback**: Text readability issues, unclear navigation, non-cohesive experience

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Text Contrast**: Upgraded all light text (text-gray-500) to darker variants (text-gray-600/700) for better readability
- **Mobile Constraints**: Fixed toast viewport to respect max-width mobile container
- **Navigation Clarity**: Replaced "Programs" with "Journal" in bottom navigation for direct workout notes access
- **Unified Design**: Simplified quick actions from dual buttons to single prominent "Start New Workout" button
- **Stats Visibility**: Enhanced welcome section stats with stronger contrast (bg-white/30, text-white with font-medium)

## Enhanced AI Context System (June 18, 2025)

**OpenAI Service Improvements**:
- **Historical Context**: Workout analysis now includes last 5 workouts for pattern recognition
- **Sophisticated Prompts**: Added comparative analysis requirements for performance trends
- **Goal Integration**: Enhanced goal progress tracking with current/target value context
- **Recovery Analysis**: AI considers rest time between sessions and muscle groups
- **Progressive Overload**: Recommendations based on performance data patterns

## Data Storage Architecture Decision

**User Question**: Store workouts locally in IndexedDB and call OpenAI directly from browser?

**Decision**: Hybrid approach for security and functionality:
- **Local Storage**: Use IndexedDB for offline workout logging via service worker
- **API Security**: Keep OpenAI calls server-side to protect API keys and implement rate limiting
- **Sync Strategy**: Store locally when offline, sync to server when online for AI processing
- **PWA Benefits**: Allows gym use without internet while maintaining AI features when connected

## User Experience Philosophy

**Design Principles**:
- **Unified Workflow**: Seamless integration between continuous journaling and exercise entry
- **Mobile-First**: All components respect mobile viewport constraints
- **Clear Navigation**: Direct access to core features without confusion
- **Readable Text**: Sufficient contrast for all text elements
- **Progressive Enhancement**: AI features enhance but don't block core functionality
