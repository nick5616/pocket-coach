# Chrome Deployment Fix - SOLUTION FOUND

## Problem Identified ✅
Chrome error "Unexpected token '<'" is caused by asset filename mismatch between build and deployment:

- **Chrome expects**: `index-CgyiaBAf.js` (old cached build)
- **Fresh build creates**: `index-DIztqsJr.js` (current build)
- **Result**: Browser gets HTML 404 page instead of JavaScript file

## Why Safari Works vs Chrome
- **Safari**: More lenient error recovery, may be serving cached working version
- **Chrome**: Strict about exact file loading, immediately fails on 404 errors

## Deployment Solution

### Step 1: Fresh Build (✅ Done)
```bash
npm run build
# Creates: dist/public/assets/index-DIztqsJr.js
```

### Step 2: Deploy with Production Settings
In Replit deployment:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

2. **Start Command**:
   ```
   node dist/index.js
   ```

3. **Clear any cached deployments** in Replit

### Step 3: Verify Fixed Issues
- ✅ Removed service worker causing `sw.js` errors
- ✅ Removed demo text from login
- ✅ Enhanced production MIME types
- ✅ Fresh build with correct asset names

## Root Cause
Production deployment was using an outdated build cache with old asset filenames. The fresh build with correct filenames resolves the Chrome JavaScript loading errors.

After redeployment with these settings, Chrome should load the app correctly.
